  You have entered a large hall filled with blackjack tables, one-armed-bandits,	and roulette wheels,  To your left a large crowd of people have gathered around 	a well-dressed man who appears to be on a hot streak.  You decide that this     	isn't your idea of entertainment so you walk back out onto the deck.
                                                                                	KKLLAAAAABBLLAAAANNGGGG!!!!!...The Titantic lurches sideways as a teeth-grinding	sound rips across the side of the ship.  You suddenly realize that the ship has 	struck an iceburg!  Even as you think the huge vessal tilts and studders,       	sinking lower and lower into the icy black ocean.  Crowds of people rush from   	every exit in a mad panic to escape the danger.
As you open the door you see the creature
The Titanic suddenly surges forward, tossing you like a matchstick against the  	deck...you are knocked out!  Passenges scramble for the lifeboats, selfishly    	ignoring your limp body.  Several minutes later you go down with the ship, death	is less painful than you had imagined.
You saw the rope feverishly until...twanggg!...it snaps under the weight of the 	boat.  The boat plummits down to the ocean's surface, impacting with a huge     	splash.  A previously unseen safety harness breaks loose from under a bench.
  A spout of hot steam forms a glowing cloud in the sky as the Titanic          	disappears below the ocean's surface.  In the distance you can barely hear the  	voices of other passengers who made it safely off the sinking ship.
  Your lifeboat is now rocking violently from waves caused by an unknown force. 	You can hear a loud gusher sound in front of your boat, which sounds much like a	waterfall!  Up ahead you see a section of the icy water that appears much darker	than the surrounding area.
You realize too late that the dark hole is a mammoth whirlpool!  Your body is   	flung to sea like a wooden doll.  Your last breath was 10 percent air and       	90 percent water, not at all a healthy mixture.
With a great pitch forward your boat is swallowed by a huge swirling whirlpool!!	As you enter the spinning vortex the great centrifigal force presses you        	against the bench, you finally pass out due to the overwhelming pressure...
You are given a life shocking jolt as you glimpse the image above you--it's the 	Titanic!!!  Resting not more than twenty feet above you is the bottom hull of   	the once mighty ship.  Dead bodies, fallen from the wreck, are scattered about  	the floor of the ice like cake decoration.  The horror is too real and you bow  	your head, unable to view the sight anymore.
Not a smart decision!  Within two seconds over 500,000 tons of ice and water    	fill the entire cavity you once stood in.  The Titanic, resting somewhere above,	also slides down, finally coming to rest about three feet from the largest      	remander of your torso.  How ironic, anyone discovering the ship will think you 	went down with in when, in fact, it went down with you!
As you finish uttering the words the hexagons within the wall begin to shudder! 	Seconds later the entire wall seems to be shaking with a life of its own, the   	whole cave seems ready to collapse!  Before your eyes the hexagons begin        	tranforming themselves into circles and, unable to fit together, they fall to   	the ground.  A minute later the remainder of the wall falls to the ground, each 	circle vanishing on impact.  Soon there is nothing left but a new passage!
The chiseled message on the cave wall reads:                                    	      " Be wary traveller--                                                     	           for finer adventures have tried...and died.                          	         A wall will block thy path,                                            	            unless these words thy have.                                        	                         Nepo Egassap "
The wall doesn't look like it was formed by natural conditions.  Its strange    	appearance looks almost alien.  The wall consists of hundreds of small hexigon  	shapes, interlocked in a perfect bond.  The pattern seems perfect--and          	purposefull.
Suddenly the flashlight flickers with its final burst of light...then goes out! 	You instantly realize the severity of the situation, and in a spasm of anger    	you toss the flashlight against the ground.  You listen with sorrow as many     	fragments hit the surrounding features.
  The passage opens up here to form a small cave.  The eastern wall has         	vanished since you spoke the strange words, leaving a new path to the east.     	A separate tunnel intersects here, with exits to the southwest and northeast.   	The main path lies to the west.
Just as the rope snaps two of the ship's police walk around the forward deck on 	their routine patrol.  Of course, they are not amused by your foolhardy deed.   	They haul you off to a secluded cabin and bolt the door from the outside!       	                         
  You are inside one of the many cages within the lower cargo bay.  The cage    	door to the west is wide open.  Gooey slime and jelly drip from the cage bars.
You leap from the rope into the dark void below, unsure of what lies below!     	A brief moment later you collide with the ground.  Several snapping noises      	catch your attention as severe stabs of pain penatrate both arms.  Your         	possesions fly in all directions on impact.
You freeze in your step as you notice the object in front of you!  It's a huge  	metal disk, at least 50 yards across and 20 feet tall.  From here it you can see	large boulders resting on top of it and all around its sides, appearently from  	an ancient rock slide.
Suddenly the computer bursts into life as a feminine voice fills the room:      	"Well hello, are you trying to turn me on?  You know, it's been some time since 	anybody requested my services.  Since the disaster, though, my memory has become	a little flaky.  If you want to view a screen just type in the number.  Let me  	check here, ah yes, I have four screens of particular interest.  Well, what are 	you waiting for, go ahead and view a few screens!"

As you enter the engine room you feel a scorching, burning all over your skin-- 	suddenly you realize the shield plate is raised!!!  You dash for the button,    	but the heat and radiation is too overwhelming.  You callapse just short of     	safety...dead.
As you remove the alien suit you notice a dramatic rise in temperature,         	suddenly you notice the protective shield is in the raised position.            	Frantically, you rush to climb back into the suit, but the effort is wasted.    	Seconds later the intense heat and radiation overwhelms you...and you stumble   	to the floor, dead.
This time you aim more carefully, the object arcs in the air and lands flat     	against the green button.  Suddenly the lamp above you sparks to life, bathing  	you in a warm light.  Almost magically your body feels alive with new life, the 	pain in your arms fades away.  The lamp crackles for a moment, then cuts off.
...Suddenly you feel intense heat crawling over your body, bubbles form on your 	skin, exploding with bright red blood.  You dive for the exit, but collapse     	just short.  Seconds later you pass out...and die.
Slightly hesitant, you press the tan colored button.  Instantly the shapes      	around you seem to fade, an empty feeling invades your whole body.  The world   	surrounding you blinks on and off, as though you were watching it through a     	rapid shutter.  An hour seems to pass while objects near you bend and contort   	themselves.  Suddenly all seems to stop...you fall like a bean bag to the       	ground!
  This is a completely foreign place to you, the ship's interior has vanished!  	Still a little dizzy you stand up and grab a nearby rail.  Clearing the water   	from your eyes you realize that you're standing on a bridge, which heads both   	north and south.  Underneath flows a torrid river, heading eastward.  The       	panoramic horizon appears bleak somehow, as though life was a rarity.  All      	around you everything looks neglected and decayed.
Polar Region                                                                    	  You find yourself half sunken in deep snow, the sharp wind forces you to      	close your eyes.  You sense the presence of another animal, look up, and see a  	huge white bear towering over you!  You struggle to move but the snow is too    	thick, and the creature too swift.  Within seconds the animal rips your life    	away!  Your remains become a frozen memory of your future self.
Polar Region                                                                    	  Suddenly, the ground you landed on tips over, dumping you into a frozen pot   	of ice and swirling water.  You rest for a moment while examining both sides of 	the icy canyon, slowly you realize that there's no escape, your body is numb    	with coldness.  You try desperately to climb back onto a raft of ice, but fail  	too often.  You finally give-up and sink to an icy grave.
Pitted Desert                                                                   	  Almost immediately the intense heat sends you into waves of agony.  You barely	manage to climb to a standing position.  The sensation of ants crawling all over	your body is too painful.  You look around and see a barren desert pitted with  	huge crators, metal fragments letter the sand.  The scene reminds you of a vast 	war.  Slowly, the pain becomes overwhelming...you collapse and die.
Moon Surface                                                                    	  The fall knocks the wind out of you, but when your lungs reach out for air    	they find none!  You spring to your feet and find yourself flying several feet  	across the surface.  Looking around the barren landscape you see nothing        	familiar.  You do notice, however, in place of the moon there's a strange blue  	object.  Most peculiar, you think, as your body cries for air one last time.
Suddenly a large furry creature leaps from behind one of the cages.  Before you 	can react it wraps several tight tentacles around your arms and body,  within   	seconds you pass out!
  Suddenly the ground shakes and shudders with irregular jolts, sending a new   	streak of fear crawling up your back.  The trimmer continues for about thirty   	seconds, subsides, and finally ends.
Carefully, you climb down the steep slope into the deep crater.  Nearly half    	way down you slip and tumble to the bottom, losing all of possessions in the    	process!  You pick yourself up and look around...
Slowly, but surely, you climb and grovel your way up the steep and crumbly      	slope.  Finally you reach the top.
You leap from the bridge into the fast flowing stream below.  The rapid current 	tosses you around like a twig and finally drags you underneath.
Suddenly, from behind a big boulder, a hooded, man-like figure springs forth    	and graps one of your possessions!  Before you can regain your composure and    	react the cloaked figure dissappears over the eastern edge of the crater.
Still not convinced of your decision, you enter the brilliant orange beams.     	Each limb of your body seems to suddenly vanish as it penetrates the electric   	barrier.  In an instant you materialize at a new location...
The bright orange beams seem to be vibrating with life as the race up and down  	from a slot in the ceiling to a slot in the floor.  The path of beams is about  	as wide as a large door.  There's a sign beside the beams on the wall.
The small sign reads:                                                           	                     Office Express System                                      	                       G:  Advertising.                                         	                       2:  Broadcasting.                                        	                       3:  Maintenance.                                         	                       4:  Business.
A hooded, mutant-like creature suddenly springs from behind a boulder and       	steals one of your possessions!  You struggle with it, but it manages to push   	you back over the crater's edge.  You tumble down the steep slope as the mutant 	escapes to safety.
You bend down to the rusty lock's level and insert the piece of wire into the   	hole.  You spend several minutes wiggling and twisting the wire, trying to pick 	the lock open.  Your patience just about expires when...click!...the cabinet    	door springs open!
  Below you lies a small, muddy lake, probably nearing the end of its existence.	A very small stream breaks off to the southwest, but fades into nothing within  	a quarter of a mile.
  Below you appears to be the remains of a small town.  The entire area is      	riddled with small pits, craters and depressions.  In your mind you picture     	what might of happened here, the thought is not a pretty one.
  You've entered a desert area, except for the lack of rolling sand dunes.  The 	whole area does not seem natural, as if it was once a pasture teaming with life.	On the horizon you can see a few mountains.
  You are above a desert area that is covered with craters and pits, all        	relatively small in comparison with others you've seen.  Mixed in with the sand 	you can barely see jagged pieces of concrete and other rubble.                  	On the horizon you can see a few mountains.
  You are above the fast flowing river that passes by the large building and    	broken bridge.  The river flows from the southwest and bends north here.  A     	half mile north, though, the river curves hard to the right again and fades in  	the distance.
  You are flying above a stream that probably comes from the mountains in the   	distance.  The stream doesn't hold much water and looks like it's about to run  	dry pretty soon.
  Below is a very small town that probably had a population less than 50 people.	The place looks deserted now, abandoned vehicles of some kind litter the roads. 	Several roads exit the town, heading off in random, appearently pointless       	directions.
  You are above one of the many mountains in this area.  A small, slow flowing  	streams flows from a cave at the base of one of the mountains here.  All around 	you the desert-like landscape spreads to the horizon.  These mountains are the  	only break in the flatness.  The clouds above you cast eerie shadow on the      	mountain sides.
  You are flying above a huge crater like the one by the broken bridge.  Rubble 	is scattered all around the crater's edges, mixed with large boulders.
  Below you are a few small hills that build up to the mountains in the near    	distance.  A slim stream winds its way through the tangled arrangement and      	bends towards the west into the flatland area.
  Below is a small crack in the Earth forming a shallow canyon, about 100 yards 	across and a half mile long.  The large shadows of the thich, hazy clouds       	blocks the light enough so that you can't see into the canyon very well.
  The desert-like area blends into a less sandy area here, and forms a small    	region of hard flatland.  This might have been a large, shallow lake in the     	past, fed from streams that came from the mountains in the distance.
  You are above a large dry lake area, the cracked clay pan area gives a clear  	indication to the once water-filled area.  The shadows of clouds roam across    	the empty area, heading southward.
  You are above a vast desert area.  Above you is a thick layer of clouds,      	which blocks out at least 50 oercent of the sun's light.  In the distance you   	can see a small mountain range.
  You are above a concrete bridge that crosses the same river that passes the   	large building.  This bridge is in fairly good shape and provides a complete    	passage for the road that meets it.  The road heads northward, but slowly       	curves to the east.
Without warning, the shuttle's engine begins to humm with activity, suddenly you	are jolted back into the seat as the shuttle raises from the roof and high into 	the sky.  You finally level out about a half of a mile below the thick cloud    	cover...
Abruptly the steady humming of the shuttle's engine ceases!  The shuttle tips   	over nose first and plummits toward Earth.  The tremendous gravitational forces 	push all of your limbs back against the seat.  You watch helplessly, and in     	terror as the ground rushes closer...and closer...and closer...and CRASH!!!
As you move the lever an unforseen panel in the roof slowly slides open.  A     	great rush of wind whips your hair around as you watch.  Suddenly your seat     	snaps upward, ejecting you from the shuttle!!!  You glide freely to the Earth,  	enjoying its natural beauty as you fall.  Maybe, you wonder, you were supposed  	to have the parachute before you used the lever...SPLAT!!!
The shuttle's engine seems to strain and vibrate as the nose angles upward.     	You are again forced back into your seat as the shuttle moves closer to the     	thick layer of clouds above.  Turbulence rocks the shuttle around as it enters  	the clouds, you can see nothing.  Within moments, however, the shuttle rises    	above the cloud barrier.  You are greeted with an amazing and unbelievable      	sight...a gigantic floating structure, resembling a large city.
As you take the key from its slot the shuttle's engine whines, then stops!  The 	vehicle suddenly tilts forward, spiraling towards the ground.  The tremendous   	gravitational forces prevent you from putting the key back in.  You watch with  	horror as the ground moves closer...and closer...and closer...and CRASH!!!
As you remove the helmet from your head the shuttle begins to tilt to the side. 	Suddenly it begins to spiral down to Earth!  The whiplash caused you to drop the	helmet on the floor.  And the great force of the fall prevents you from leaning 	over and picking it up.  You watch helplessly, and with frustration, as the     	shuttle plummits closer to the ground, and closer...and closer...and CRASH!!!
The shuttle tilts forward a little and heads southward, dropping slightly in    	altitude.  As you move closer to the landing area you notice some rubble        	directly in your path.  Too late to react, though, you brace yourself against   	the seat as the shuttle hits the jagged piece of concrete...the shuttle slides  	for about 60 feet before coming to rest.  As you check yourself over, you       	notice a thin whisp of smoke coming from the shuttle's controls.
  From here you can see many large buildings and towers, with an interlaced     	network of roads and tubes weaving in an around the other structures.  A bright 	glow radiates downward from under the city, disappearing into the dusty clouds.
  You enter the room thinking about the distinctively repulsive smell.  From the	corner of the room you hear a strange gurgling noise, look up, and freeze in    	your tracks!  Standing there, with slime dripping from its gapping mouth, is a  	creature groveling in the food supply.  Its three arms shoveling food in its    	jaws with timed precision.  Hearing your sweat drip on the floor, the creature  	looks up, sees you, and lunges toward you with burning eyes!
  The large monster is about eight feet tall, with three long arms fitted with  	thick claws.  Its slobbering jaws drip with slime.
The slobbering monster dives at your feet and catches your leg with one of its  	clawed hands!  As it climbs to its feet though, you fly into a wild struggle    	and just manage to shake loose.  You jump forward, perform an acrobatic roll,   	spring to your feet, and sprint away!  The creature, however, is still right    	behind you.
The creature, with its deadly clawed arms swinging wildly, follows you stride   	for stride.  It's sharp claws nipping at you back!
A mysterious figure begins to appear in front of you, forming out of thin air!  	You realize from its hulking shape that it's the creature, it must of been too  	close to you when you transported back, you deduce.  Within seconds the full    	body of the creature appears before you.  However, the creature seems to stumble	around for a moment, possibly a little dizzle from its unexpected ride!
An intense heat seems to engulf the room as everything around you begins to take	on a glow of its own, including the alien creature!  The creature's eyes bulge  	as it realizes its situation.  Its three arms shrivel as it roars in pain.      	Before your eyes the monster melts into a bubbling puddle of gooey remains!  As 	the puddle sreads over the floor a small tape cartridge is revealed,            	appearently devoured by the creature earlier.
On the screen you see a series of photos flash by, all of which look like       	pictures of cities.  The film abruptly stops on a particular picture you easily 	recognize, it's a photo of a park just outside San Francisco!!!  In the corner  	of the screen is the number 1933.
As you reach for the tan colored button the alien creature lunges at you and    	bumps you to the ground.  The struggle does not last long.  The monster feasts  	on your meaty bones!
The pictures on the screen have stopped on a familiar photo of a park just      	outside San Francisco!  Appearently the aliens were using the time chair to     	examine future Earth cultures.  A number in the corner of the screen looks like 	a date!  The number is 1933.
You hit a soft patch of grass, look up, and view several tall, green trees,     	swaying in a cool harbor breeze.  You easily recognize this place as the same   	spot as in the screen photo!  Several people are staring at you from the        	distance, somewhat amazed by your unannounced appearance!  You pick yourself up 	a begin walking toward a police station on the corner.  As you walk you wonder  	who will be crazy enough to believe your story!!
                                                                                	The alien creatures lurks around the lower bay until it sees you trapped in the 	cage.  With its three clawed arms slashing away it shreds you into little bits, 	which are carefully cleaned up by the resident rats!
                                                                                	The monster grabs with two of its three clawed arms and rips you to shreds with 	its middle arm.  Hours later you provide a royal feast for the resident rats!
                                                                                	The monster leaps across the room and knocks you to the ground.  You struggle   	with it as it wraps you up in its arms and begins feasting on your tasty skin!  	A few hours later your discarded bones provide the perfect start to a rat's     	nest.
The creature reaches out with one of its three clawed hands and grabs your arm. 	You try to break free, but the monster is too strong.  It breaks your arms and  	legs so that you can't get away, then the slobbering monster moves in for the   	kill.  You close your eyes and....
                 - - - - - - -  W A R N I N G  - - - - - - -                    	                                                                                	This lever to be used only in case of an emercency.  The pilot MUST be properly 	equipped.  This lever is not a toy!!!  Use only as a last resort.  DANGER!!!!!!
  You are inside a shuttle that is flying high above the ground.  In front of   	you is control panel covered with complicated looking equipment.  Notable is an 	oversized white button with a keyhole below it.  Also catching you attention is 	a large lever coming from the floor, and a bright red sign to the right of the  	lever.
